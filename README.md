# 📊 Credit Risk Analysis — Machine Learning Project

## 🧠 Project Overview
This repository contains a complete end-to-end **credit risk analysis project** that predicts whether credit applicants are likely to default. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, and comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess lending/credit dataset
- Engineer meaningful features to improve model performance
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models
- Compare results using performance metrics (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score)
- Provide insights for risk mitigation and decision support

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** (Mention the dataset origin — e.g., Kaggle / UCI / Public repo)  
- **Content:** Credit and financial data with applicant profiles and target label (good/bad credit)
